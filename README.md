## LATEST UPDATES :loudspeaker:

### 8/April/2017
Progress has been slow on the project this week due to working everyday at my day job and with personal training clients!  However, I have been able to read up on some documentation, previous unit tests and other programming principles that will be implemented immediately.  Although not as much development work got done as I hoped, there has been enough time for me to write a few blogs this week that were helpful to my train of thought.

> Make sure to follow the blog for this project!  It's as important as the code repo because I am sharpening my project planning/management skill while working several jobs at once.

## 11/April/2017
Finished my initial testing phase today!  Time to start Phase 3 early by adjusting my schedule.

Please share this repo and the blog with up-and-coming web developers that it may help!  Thanks.
