## LATEST UPDATES :loudspeaker:

### 8/April/2017
Progress has been slow on the project this week due to working everyday at my day job and with personal training clients!  However, I have been able to read up on some documentation, previous unit tests and other programming principles that will be implemented immediately.  Although not as much development work got done as I hoped, there has been enough time for me to write a few blogs this week that were helpful to my train of thought.

> Make sure to follow the blog for this project!  It's as important as the code repo because I am sharpening my project planning/management skill while working several jobs at once.

Finished my initial testing phase today!  Time to start Phase 3 early by adjusting my schedule.

Please share this repo and the blog with up-and-coming web developers that it may help!  Thanks.

## 16/April/2017
Templating process is beginning tomorrow with any additional tests being written as needed.

## 18/April/2017
Decided to go with more conventional structure for the app, so I quickly rearranged a few things and made sure all my tests were passing.  Tomorrow will be the beginning of a new phase in development, I am going to experiment with different workflow methods that will allow me to build this project in my spare time while I work full time!

## BASIC INFO :information_source:
